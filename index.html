    <p class="fade fade-delay"><strong>I'm Reman Dey</strong>, a B.Tech student in <strong>Engineering Physics</strong> at <strong>IIT Mandi</strong>.</p>
    <p class="fade fade-more">I’m fascinated by how physical principles shape the universe and how code helps us explore it. 
                              Being a physics enthusiast with a profound passion for hands-on innovation and solving challenging, research-oriented physics problems, my journey in STEM is driven by a relentless curiosity and a desire to turn complex ideas into tangible creations.</p> 
     <p class="fade fade-more">When I’m not studying, I’m probably building something, breaking it, or thinking about why it works. 
                              You can explore my innovative projects and their results on <a href="https://remandey.github.io/my-portfolio/">my portfolio</a></p>
